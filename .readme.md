# 🚀 Node.js Internals & Module System Guide

This guide offers a detailed and beginner-friendly explanation of how Node.js operates under the hood. It covers essential topics such as the Node.js environment, event loop, libuv, asynchronous task management, and the CommonJS module system.

---

## 📌 What is Node.js?

**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's **V8 engine** that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. It is designed for building scalable network applications using a non-blocking, event-driven architecture.

---

## 🧠 Node.js Core Architecture

### Key Components:
- **V8 Engine**: Compiles and executes JavaScript.
- **libuv**: A C++ library that handles the event loop, asynchronous I/O operations, and the thread pool.
- **Event Loop**: Core mechanism that manages non-blocking asynchronous callbacks.
- **Thread Pool**: Used for executing heavy tasks like file I/O and cryptography.
- **Bindings**: Interface between JavaScript and native C/C++ code.

## 🔄 Event Loop - The Heart of Node.js

The **Event Loop** allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations by offloading operations to the system kernel or libuv.

### Event Loop Phases:
1. **Timers**: Executes `setTimeout` and `setInterval` callbacks.
2. **Pending Callbacks**: Executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop.
3. **Idle, Prepare**: Internal phase for libuv.
4. **Poll**: Retrieves new I/O events; executes I/O-related callbacks.
5. **Check**: Executes `setImmediate()` callbacks.
6. **Close Callbacks**: Executes close events (e.g., `socket.on('close')`).

### Microtask Queue:
- `process.nextTick()` and **Promises** are processed between each event loop phase.
- `process.nextTick()` has higher priority than Promises.

## ⚙️ libuv & Asynchronous Task Management

- **libuv** is responsible for abstracting non-blocking I/O operations across platforms.
- It manages the **thread pool** to handle heavy async tasks like:
  - File system operations
  - DNS lookups
  - Cryptographic tasks

Node.js appears single-threaded but leverages this thread pool for concurrent processing.

---

## 🧵 Is Node.js Single-Threaded?

Yes, Node.js uses a **single thread** to execute JavaScript, but uses multiple threads in the background for asynchronous operations via **libuv**.

| Layer             | Threads |
|------------------|---------|
| JS Execution      | 1 (Main Thread) |
| libuv Thread Pool | 4 (default, configurable) |

---

## 🧰 `process.nextTick()` vs `setTimeout()` vs `setImmediate()`

| Method              | When It Executes               | Priority      |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|
| `process.nextTick()` | Immediately after current operation | Highest       |
| `Promise.then()`   | Microtask queue (after phase)   | High          |
| `setTimeout()`     | Timers Phase                    | Normal        |
| `setImmediate()`   | Check Phase                     | Lower         |

---

## 📦 Node.js Module System (CommonJS)

Node.js uses the **CommonJS** module system to handle imports and exports.

### Exporting a Module

```js
// math.js
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

module.exports = { add, subtract };
```

### Importing a Module

```js
// index.js
const math = require('./math');
console.log(math.add(5, 3)); // Output: 8
```

---

## 🔍 How `require()` Works Internally

1. **Module Resolution**: Finds the actual file path.
2. **Caching**: Checks if the module is already loaded in `require.cache`.
3. **Wrapping**: Wraps module content inside a function:
   ```js
   (function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
     // module code here
   });
   ```
4. **Execution**: The wrapped function is executed.
5. **Returning Exports**: Returns the value of `module.exports`.

---

## 📌 Summary

- Node.js is event-driven and non-blocking.
- Internals rely on the V8 engine and libuv.
- The Event Loop is central to async handling.
- CommonJS modules use `require()` and `module.exports`.

---

## 🧪 Recommended Practice

- Explore async behavior using `setTimeout`, `nextTick`, and Promises.
- Use `fs`, `crypto`, or `dns` modules to see thread pool in action.
- Build and structure projects using modular code with CommonJS.

Happy Nodejs Journey! 🎉
